___
ü§ñ Telegram Manager is an aiogram-based project that provides a Telegram bot designed to manage activity within Telegram channels. The bot allows users to add bot accounts that will perform various tasks, such as subscribing, unsubscribing, viewing posts, and clicking on inline buttons within the channel.

üí™ With Telegram Manager, users can easily automate their channel management process by setting task schedules for bot accounts. Users can set how many subscriptions or unsubscriptions occur per hour, control the frequency of post views and click actions, and manage all tasks with ease. In addition, the bot enables users to pause, resume, and delete tasks at any time.

üöÄ Overall, Telegram Manager is a powerful tool for those looking to enhance their Telegram channel's performance through automated management techniques.
